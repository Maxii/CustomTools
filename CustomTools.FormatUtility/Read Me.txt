FormatUtility is a Windows forms application that allows you to apply 
standard or custom format strings to either numeric values or date and
time values. A text box then displays the result string.

You indicate whether the input value is a date/time or a number by 
selecting a radio button. The date/time or numeric value is interepreted
using the conventions of the current culture.

A drop-down combo box allows you to either select one of the supported
standard format strings, or you can enter your own standard or custom 
format string. Note that the numeric standard format strings do not 
include precision specifiers; if you want to include a precision
specifier in a format string, you must enter it yourself.
